title: PW4 - Event Binding
---

> If you start from this step, just move to PW3 tag `git checkout PW3`

In this part we are dealing with event and user action.

- First of all let's play with `keyup` event on search input to display the search words in the DOM.

- In a second part, import `FormsModule` to play with *banana box* `ngModel` directive.

- Filter the pokemeon list based on searchValue with a method

- Create a Angular Pipe with

```bash
ng generate pipe filter-pokemon
```

and use it to filter your pokemons.
